V 2.0

Requirements:
Python 3.X (sqlite 3 might have to be downloaded seperately)

Installation instructions:
1) Place paths.txt, Set_up.py, and Deck_Extractor.py in some folder convenient to you. I myself place them in a new folder: /Ygopro/Deck_Extractor/
2) Open paths.txt
	a) Change the second line to the pathway to your YGOpro folder (ending in /ygopro/)
	b) Change the fourth line to the path whichever folder you want the output to go to.
	c) If you're doing this on mac or linux or other, let me know if this works for you.
	
Instructions:
1) Run Deck_Extractor.py, I recommend making a shortcut in a convenient place
2) Enter the name of the deck. You should't type the .ydk extension.
3) Enter in the desired name of the output file (output is a .txt file).
